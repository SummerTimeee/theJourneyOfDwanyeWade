            <p id="bold">Former President Barack Obama congratulates Dwyane Wade on his NBA career</p>

            <p> The most notable one coming from big basketball fan and the 44th President of the United States: Barack
                Obama.

                "D-Wade! Congratulations on a great run. Now, I know what you're going through, because saying goodbye
                to a career that you love is never easy. I've been there. In my case though, I didn't really have a
                choice. My knees were shot so I had to give up basketball forever," Obama cracked. </p>

            <p id="bold"> Dwyane Wade scored 30 points (10-of-23 FGs, 6-of-6 FTs) in his final home game in Miami on
                Tuesday,adding three rebounds, three assists, one block and four 3-pointers in 35 minutes against the
                76ers.</p>
            <p>The Miami crowd saw their superstar show out one last time in what was a memorable evening for many
                people involved. Their were multiple video tributes for Wade (one linked below), who became visibly
                emotional prior to tip-off. The Heat were eliminated from the playoffs with the Pistons win over the
                Grizzlies, which means that Wade's last NBA game will be on Wednesday in Brooklyn. </p>

            <p id="bold"> Dwyane Wade insists he never thought he’d play with LeBron James</p>
            <p>The first half of this decade was no doubt dominated by the Miami Heat. The franchise
                formed one of the most talented rosters in the history of the league when they signed
                LeBron James and Chris Bosh back in 2010 to team up with the mainstay Dwyane Wade.</p>

            <p>“I’m trying my inner Allen Iverson,” he said after practice Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena, in advance
                of Wednesday night’s visit by the Golden State Warriors.

                Having grown out his hair, the 37-year-old icon said he felt the time was right for something different.

                “There’s a lot of factors,” he said. “I’ve been growing my hair. I’m growing my hair to do different
                looks and I decided to do a different look. Once I got it done, I was like, ‘You know what? I’m going to
                do it in a game.’ “</p>
